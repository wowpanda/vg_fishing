Fishing Script for FiveM
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Script was built on top of a Version of the Fishingscript of FiveM-Forum-User Kuzkay. 
His allowence was given.

Also i used code of Thaisen69 AnchorBoat Script https://github.com/Thaisen69/AnchorBoat

And of course the great script InteractSound from Scott: https://forum.fivem.net/t/release-play-custom-sounds-for-interactions/8282

aaand NativeUI: https://forum.fivem.net/t/release-nativeui-port-for-p/4902

Created by lyrics --> VG-Community (LivingInLosSantos)

Biggest difference:
- sounds
- uses nativeUI for the shopsystem instead of esx_shops, but still uses esx for fishing and items to be compatible with esx
- knife has to be bought in order to be allowed to process fish and use/sell it
- no visible mapmarkers for illegal stuff (shark sellpoint)
- boat has anchor
- no boat rent avaible, as in our community we decided that you should use your bought boat, so it has a purpose
- other markers

..and some other small things.
Also i made fish eatable on our server, you should do that too.
